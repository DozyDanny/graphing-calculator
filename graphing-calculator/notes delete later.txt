mainform.h -> panel, m, exponent, b, text 1 2 and 3, go button
graphingcalculator.h

mainform has 20 lines on the panel to draw the graph

form size of 500x500, nonresizable, and a go button too

graphing calculator:
-we need an array with 21 spots, a double array to be exact
-double points[21] = new double[]; //something like this???
-calculatepoints uses y=mx+b to find the points

0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21 //20 lines are here <---

-setpoints
-getpoints
-drawpoints

should be pretty simple to put together
